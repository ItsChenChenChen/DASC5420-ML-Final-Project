A series of classification methods, including Logistic Regression, K-nearest
Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, and Random Forest is implemented to predict whether the wine is good quality or not based on its characteristics. Inferred from the exploratory data analysis, no strong linear correlations exist between the predictors and the response. Cross-validation is used to find optimal parameters when applicable. Results show that Random Forest produces the best prediction accuracy on the test set while Decision Tree has the lowest.
